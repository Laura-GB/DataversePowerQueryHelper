# Dataverse Power Query Helper
Tools built using Excel VBA to help build Power Query code to access a Dataverse environment. 

## Tools
* Creates a list of entities to select
* For every selected entity creates a tab containing all the columns names
* Creates the Power Query M code from the selected columns

## 12 Oct 2021 Upload
* Tweaked step names to be simpler - Navigation is now just called Navigation
* Added FilterStatus step before SelectColumns on the Status not equal to Inactive

## 13 July 2021 Upload
* Added view columns to each table to show which columns are used in views.
